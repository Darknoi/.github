Game in development: Korpus  
KORPUS is a cooperative game about a team of five classified operatives managing an underground research complex built around two unique artifacts — the TL-Anchor and the Echo-Node.  
The primary objective is to harvest purified energy (Echo-current) from hostile anomalies born of the Void — an ocean of humanity's collective unconscious.  
Players engage with anomalies of five risk classes by performing automated tasks (maintenance, communication, adaptation, suppression) to study them and maintain the facility's operations.  
Progress carries over across three cycles of 27 days, during which the secrets of the artifacts, the complex, and the forces vying for influence in a post-apocalyptic world are gradually revealed.  
   
Genre: Cooperative Horror-Management | Platform: PC | Players: 1–5
